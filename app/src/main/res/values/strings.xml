    <string name="chapter_13_article_text">
        In a vault deep inside Abbey Road Studios in London — protected by an unmarked, triple-locked,
        police-alarmed door — are something like 400 hours of unreleased Beatles recordings, starting from June 2,
        1962 and ending with the very last tracks recorded for the <i>Let It Be</i> album. The best of the best
        were released by Apple Records in the form of the 3-volume Anthology series.
         For more information, see the Beatles Time Capsule at www.rockument.com.
        \n\n
        This volume starts with the first new Beatle song, “Free as a Bird” (based on a John Lennon demo, found
        only on <i>The Lost Lennon Tapes Vol. 28</i>, and covers the very earliest historical recordings,
        outtakes from the first albums, and live recordings from early concerts and BBC Radio sessions.
        \n\n
        <b>Highlights include:</b>
        \n\n
        <b><i>Cry for a Shadow</i></b> - Many a Beatle fanatic started down the outtake road, like I did, with a
        first listen to this song. Originally titled “Beatle Bop” and recorded in a single session that yielded four
        songs (the other three featured Tony Sheridan with the Beatles as a backing band), “Cry for a Shadow” is
        an instrumental written by Lennon and Harrison, which makes it unique to this day. John Lennon plays
        rhythm guitar, George Harrison plays lead guitar, Paul McCartney plays bass, and Pete Best plays drums.
        The sessions were produced by Bert Kaempfert in Hamburg, Germany, during the Beatles’ second visit
        from April through July of 1961 to play in the Reeperbahn-section clubs.
        \n\n
        <b><i>My Bonnie</i></b> and <b><i>Ain’t She Sweet</i></b> — At the same session, the Beatles
        played on “My Bonnie” (the first-ever single with Beatles playing), as the backing band for English singer
        Tony Sheridan, originally a member of the Jets. The popularity of this single in Liverpool brought the
        Beatles to the attention of Brian Epstein, who worked in the NEMS record store and tried to meet
        demand for the disc. John Lennon then sings a fine “Ain’t She Sweet” (his first-ever released vocal).
        \n\n
        <b><i>Searchin</i></b> — A Jerry Leiber - Mike Stoller comedy song that was a hit for the Coasters in
        1957, and a popular live favorite of the Beatles. The Coasters also had a hit with “Besame Mucho” and
        the Beatles covered that song as well. Ringo Starr had by now replaced Pete Best on drums. The high
        falsetto is George, who also plays a hesitant lead guitar. This is from their first audition for Decca
        Records in London on Jan 1., 1962, live in the studio. The Grateful Dead would later cover “Searchin”
        with a similar arrangement, Pigpen doing the Paul vocals. A live version is available on outtake records
        featuring the Dead joined by the Beach Boys!
        \n\n
        <b><i>Love Me Do</i></b> — An early version of the song, played a bit slower and with more of a blues
        feeling, and a cool bossa-nova beat in middle. Paul had to sing while John played harmonica — a first for
        the group. Pete Best played drums on this version.
        \n\n
        <b><i>She Loves You – Till There Was You – Twist and Shout</i></b> — Live at the Princess Wales
        Theatre by Leicester Square in London, attended by the Queen. “Till There Was You” (by Meredith
        Wilson) is from the musical The Music Man and a hit for Peggy Lee in 1961. Before playing it, Paul said it
        was recorded by his favorite American group, “Sophie Tucker” (which got some laughs). At the end, John
        tells the people in the cheaper seats to clap their hands, and the rest to “rattle your jewelry” and then
        announces “Twist and Shout” (a song by Bert Russell and Phil Medley that was first recorded in 1962 by
        the Isley Brothers). A film of the performance shows the Queen smiling at John’s remark.
        \n\n
        <b><i>Leave My Kitten Alone</i></b> — One of the lost Beatle songs recorded during the “Beatles For
        Sale” sessions but never released. This song, written by Little Willie John, Titus Turner, and James
        McDougal, was a 1959 R&amp;B hit for Little Willie John and covered by Johnny Preston before the
        Beatles tried it and shelved it. A reference to a “big fat bulldog” may have influenced John’s “Hey
        Bulldog” (Yellow Submarine album), which is a similar rocker.
        \n\n
        <b><i>One After 909</i></b> — A song recorded for the <i>Let It Be</i> album was actually worked on
        way back in the beginning, six years earlier. This take shows how they did it much more slowly, with an
        R&amp;B feel to it.</string>
